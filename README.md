# Introduction

This repository contains the materials for the [New Vinegar Hill project](https://www.commerce.virginia.edu/news/mcintire-professor-bevin6366) contribution effort, EduKomics, in the People and Public Policy course, Open Source for the Common Good, at the [University of Virginia](www.virginia.edu). It contains all of the sprites, comic-style panels, and possible implementations (lesson plans) that will be put on the public [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/) for client access, as well as developer examples and student submissions for the [Wordpress site](https://www.edukomics.wordpress.com/).

# Project Description

This project is one of a series of projects intended to contribute to the [New Vinegar Hill project](https://www.commerce.virginia.edu/news/mcintire-professor-bevin6366), a renewal effort dedicated to improving the quality of life of the residents of underprivileged communities, including but not limited to the Vinegar Hill community in Charlottesville, where a thriving neighborhood was demolished in 1964 in an attempt at urban renewal and is still a disadvantaged community deprived of many goods and services provided to the rest of Charlottesville.

Our goal as a branch of the Education sector is to provide equity in the classroom through quality of learning by promoting a cheap, easy way to simultaneously provide enjoyment and education in the classroom through in-classroom use of creating and/or reading short, educational comic books. Students can use resources provided in the [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/) to make their own educational comics in class, which will promote accelerated and enjoyable learning through creativity and peer education.

The EduKomics project objectives are as follows:
+ Create and update a [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/) containing sprites/characters, speech bubbles, individual comic panels, and comic single-page templates
+ Create and maintain a [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/) website containing the following:
  + [Blog](https://edukomics.wordpress.com/) page -- the first viewed page containing both submissions and developer examples. Can access by clicking title
  + [Home](https://edukomics.wordpress.com/home/) page with an introduction to teacher directives and a link to the aforementioned [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/).
  + [About Us](https://edukomics.wordpress.com/about-us/) page containing purpose of this project as well as research to why this purpose is viable for this project
  + [Contact Us](https://edukomics.wordpress.com/contact/) page (NOT for submissions), for client feedback and/or suggestions
  + [Submissions](https://edukomics.wordpress.com/tag/submissions/) page for posting submissions sent by student clients
+ Receive, review, and upload submissions sent to the email address (temporarily [yk8mp@virginia.edu](mailto:yk8mp@virginia.edu)) to the website.

# Vinegar Hill, A History

Charlottesville's Vinegar Hill became a focal point for African-American residential and social life in following the 1863 Emancipation Proclamation, and despite the *Brown v. Board of Education* decision in 1954, remained in state-sanctioned segregation in both education and employment from the rest of Charlottesville, leading to a close-knit community that, despite its disadvantages in housing or business prospects, was largely thriving on its own.

Vinegar Hill continued to thrive until Charlottesville's urban renewal project in the 1960s, in which the community was largely demolished as part of Charlottesville's "slum-cleansing" efforts for urban renewal, with 29 businesses disrupted and over 600 people moved to public housing in Westhaven. The area, after being left empty for 20 years, became the site for hotels, businesses, and restaurants.

The shadow of Vinegar Hill rests just west of what is now the Charlottesville Downtown Mall.
