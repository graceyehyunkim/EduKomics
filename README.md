# Introduction

This repository contains the materials for the Vinegar Hill project, EduKomics, in the People and Public Policy course, Open Source for the Common Good, at the [University of Virginia](www.virginia.edu). It contains all of the sprites, comic-style panels, and possible implementations (lesson plans) that will be put on the public [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/) for client access, as well as developer examples and student submissions for the [Wordpress site](https://www.edukomics.wordpress.com/).

# Repository Contents

**Note that this is still a work in progress. No considerations for modifications will be accepted until initial project has been completed.**

# Contributing to this Repository

Updates to the repository are restricted to approved individuals only, to prevent unnecessary and undocumented modification to project details. However, because this is a project created to be modified in a fashion conducive to our open source license, in the future, steps for how to contribute to this project while maintaining its integrity will be provided. Currently, this remains a private project until initial format has been solidified.

# Project Description

This project is one of a series of projects intended to contribute to the Vinegar Hill project, a renewal effort dedicated to improving the quality of life of the residents of the Vinegar Hill community in Charlottesville, where a thriving neighborhood was demolished in 1965 in an attempt at urban renewal and is still a disadvantaged community deprived of many goods and services provided to the rest of Charlottesville. Our goal as a branch of the Education sector is to provide equity in the classroom through quality of learning, promoting a cheap, easy way to simultaneously provide enjoyment and education in the classroom.

The EduKomics project objectives are as follows:
+ Create and update a Google Drive containing sprites/characters, speech bubbles, individual comic panels, and comic single-page templates
+ Create and maintain a [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/) website containing the following:
..+ [Home](https://edukomics.wordpress.com/home/) page with an introduction to teacher directives and a link to the aforementioned Google Drive
..+ [About Us](https://edukomics.wordpress.com/about-us/) page containing purpose of this project as well as research to why this purpose is viable for this project
..+ [Contact Us](https://edukomics.wordpress.com/contact/) page (NOT for submissions), for client feedback and/or suggestions
..+ [Submissions](https://edukomics.wordpress.com/tag/submissions/) page for posting submissions sent by students
..+ [Blog](https://edukomics.wordpress.com/) page -- the actual home page containing both submissions and developer examples
