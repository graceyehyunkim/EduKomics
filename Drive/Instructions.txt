Instructions for how to use characters and panels (or at least their intended use, step-by-step for easy teacher access)

This project is one of a series of projects intended to contribute to the New Vinegar Hill project, a renewal effort dedicated to improving the quality of life of the residents of underprivileged communities, including but not limited to the more disadvantaged communities of Charlottesville reminiscient of the first Vinegar Hill.

Our goal as a branch of the Education sector is to provide equity in the classroom through quality of learning by promoting a cheap, easy way to simultaneously provide enjoyment and education in the classroom through in-classroom use of creating and/or reading short, educational comic books. Students can use resources provided in the Google Drive to make their own educational comics in class, which will promote accelerated and enjoyable learning through creativity and peer
education.
